# Power Level, an EDH tier list tool

### [Link to Site](https://power-level-client.herokuapp.com/)

It may take a moment to spin up do to the service currently used.

## Purpose

I wanted to create a site where you can create a tier list specifically for commanders in the Magic the Gathering format Commander. Current tools that exist online are more generalized. Since my friend and I rank commanders every few sets, creating a site that provides all the functionality we needed was a great exercise.

## Growth and Learning

- Homebrewed a basic drag and drop implementation for the site.

- Managing state in combination with cached data on localStorage.

- The site allowed me to further extend my Typescript knowledge.

- Creating an export functionality

## Tools Used

The site uses a MERN stack.

- With MongoDB as a database to store data from Scryfall as needed.

- Express, mongoose for the NodeJS server.

- React with Typescript on the frontend.

- Axios for requests to the server.

- Utilized the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api)
